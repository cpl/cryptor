The project is currently undergoing a major "spring cleaning", expect to see
development start again in April 2019. Cryptor will be re-designed from the
ground up, major changes will take place in terms of implementation but the
goal, mission and promises are the same. Cryptor will bring back what the
internet used to be, a medium for free speech and ideas.
